QEats Food Ordering app
Spring Boot, Spring Data, REST API, Jackson, Mockito, JUnit, MongoDB
I had build different parts of the QEats backend which is a Spring Boot application.
Several REST API endpoints were implemented to query restaurant information and place food orders.
To give a sense of real-world problems, production issues were investigated using Scientific Debugging methods.
Along with this, I improved the app performance under large load scenarios as well as included an advanced search feature in the app.


Improved Performance


Used MongoDB queries to enable users to search for restaurants using attributes like name, cuisine, dish, and price.
Used multithreading to increase the number of concurrent searches that can be performed.
